# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 8/19/2023

Developers built the Voltage app as a free app. This application is intended for use as is.

## Information Collection and Use

The app "Voltage" does not collect any personal information from users. The app only scans vehicle-related data using the ELM327 OBD2 Bluetooth adapter and displays this data to users.

## Log Data

With the user's explicit consent, the application has the capability to collect and send logs to the developer for the purpose of improving the app's performance and fixing issues. These logs may include information such as device information, app usage, and technical data.

## Non-personal data collection

With the explicit user's consent, the application collects non-personal information such as car model, model year, battery capacity, odometer, and high voltage isolation. It will be used for statistics and will be available for users.

## Security

We value your trust in providing us with your vehicle-related data and logs, and we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
